Spinning Donut written in C

This code was inspired by the original 2006 Spinning Donut made by Andy Sloane.
You'll find the explaination of the maths behind the code here .https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html  
Make sure to append th -lm to the end of your gcc command because the code implements math.h lib.
